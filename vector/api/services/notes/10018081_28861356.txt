Social History (SH):
The patient lives alone, has no known close contacts with confirmed cases of COVID-19. She is currently under home quarantine following attendance at the large indoor gathering one month ago.

Physical Examination (PE):
Vital signs show tachypnea (28 breaths per minute), hypoxia with an oxygen saturation level of 88%, and a fever of 38Â°C. Physical examination reveals crackles in bilateral lower lung fields, decreased tactile fremitus over the right hemithorax, increased resonance noted on percussion, and diminished breath sounds in the right middle lobe.

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging studies, the primary diagnosis is severe community-acquired pneumonia with respiratory failure likely secondary to viral infection. Differential diagnoses include atypical pneumonia or sepsis.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
The patient will be admitted under isolation protocols to a dedicated COVID-19 unit for close monitoring. Treatment will include oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula, hydration through IV fluids, and antiviral therapy targeting suspected etiologic agents based on local prevalence patterns. Close monitoring of respiratory status, vital signs, and laboratory parameters will be essential. The patient's family will be kept informed regarding her clinical status via phone due to her current quarantine protocol. Follow-up consultations with pulmonology and infectious disease specialists are planned to further refine management strategies.
