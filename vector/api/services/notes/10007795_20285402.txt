Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10007795
- Admission ID: 20285402
- Patient Name: Nikolai Petrov
- Patient Age: 53

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on current symptoms and laboratory results, the primary concern is a gastrointestinal infection characterized by severe diarrhea with mucus and blood.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Nikolai Petrov, a 53-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with complaints of persistent watery diarrhea for four days, accompanied by abdominal cramping and frequent urges to defecate. The onset of symptoms started two days following hospitalization for an unrelated condition.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has no significant past medical history except for this recent inpatient stay where he was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for a community-acquired pneumonia. No prior gastrointestinal complaints or known allergies to medications were reported.

Medications:
During the recent hospitalization, Nikolai received intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole for four days as part of his antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. He was also administered anti-nausea medication on an as-needed basis.

Family History (FH):
No relevant family history provided at this time.

Social History (SH):
The patient reports that he consumes a varied diet, including meat, vegetables, and fruits. He denies any recent travel or contact with individuals exhibiting similar symptoms. He has been compliant with prescribed medications during his recent hospital stay.

Physical Examination:
On examination, the patient appears dehydrated but alert and oriented. Vital signs show tachycardia (105 bpm) and hypotension (98/70 mmHg). The abdomen is soft and tender to palpation in the lower quadrants without distention or guarding. Stool analysis pending.

Initial Diagnosis:
Given the clinical presentation, recent antibiotic use, and laboratory results indicating pseudomembranous colitis (inflammatory cells and fibrinogen on microscopic examination of stool), it appears that Nikolai is suffering from a severe gastrointestinal infection secondary to Clostridium difficile toxin overproduction.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
1. Immediate rehydration with IV fluids and electrolyte replacement.
2. Discontinue all broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Initiate treatment with oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for ten days, and probiotics to restore the normal gut flora.
4. Monitor vital signs closely due to dehydration and potential shock.
5. Schedule follow-up in one week or sooner if symptoms persist or worsen.
6. Educate patient on infection control measures and hand hygiene.
7. Consider consultation with gastroenterology for further evaluation if symptoms do not improve.

The primary diagnosis is a severe gastrointestinal infection likely secondary to Clostridium difficile toxin overproduction, related to recent antibiotic therapy. Immediate attention will focus on rehydration, discontinuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and initiation of targeted antimicrobial treatment (oral vancomycin) along with probiotics to restore the normal gut flora.
