Initial Diagnosis:
Pulmonary infiltrates likely due to an infectious process, with differential diagnoses including pneumonia and atypical infections. The presence of miliary lung opacities raises concern for disseminated infection. 

Plan (Treatment & Management):
Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture results. Consider antitubercular medications if clinical suspicion grows stronger based on ongoing evaluation. Order additional diagnostic tests, including sputum cultures and acid-fast bacillus staining. Consult infectious disease for management recommendations. Educate patient about the importance of adhering to treatment once determined and provide support for potential isolation at home. Arrange follow-up appointments for ongoing monitoring and management.
