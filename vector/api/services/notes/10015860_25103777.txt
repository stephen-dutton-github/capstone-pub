Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10015860
- Admission ID: 25103777
- Patient Name: Zara Malik
- Patient Age: 53 years old

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic tests, it appears that this patient is suffering from a severe respiratory infection.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Zara Malik presented to the emergency department with complaints of high fever, persistent cough, and shortness of breath. She reported feeling unwell for approximately one week prior to admission. Initially, she attributed her symptoms to allergies but grew increasingly concerned as they persisted and worsened.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are currently well-controlled with medications. There is no known history of smoking or significant alcohol use.

Medications:
Current medications include lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension and simvastatin 40 mg nightly for hyperlipidemia.

Family History (FH):
There is a family history of chronic respiratory disease in her mother, who was treated for emphysema in the past.

Social History (SH):
The patient works as an accountant and has been following proper infection control measures at work. She reports no recent travel outside the country or contact with known COVID-19 positive individuals.

Physical Examination (PE):
Upon examination, Zara Malik appears fatigued but alert. Vital signs indicate tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally, indicative of a pulmonary process. There are no other significant findings noted on physical exam.

Initial Diagnosis:
Given the clinical presentation, diagnostic tests including chest X-ray and CT scan suggest bilateral pneumonia with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Plan (Treatment & Management):
The patient will be admitted to an isolation unit due to the high suspicion for COVID-19 infection. She will receive supportive care including oxygen therapy and fluid management. Antibiotics will be initiated empirically pending further test results, as it is crucial to cover potential bacterial superinfections in severe pneumonia cases. Further testing for SARS-CoV-2 will be conducted, and isolation precautions will continue until negative results are obtained.

Additional consultations with the infectious disease team and pulmonology will be arranged. The patient's family will be updated regularly on her condition and involved in care planning decisions.
