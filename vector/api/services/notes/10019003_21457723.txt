Initial Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation and diagnostic test results (not specified in this template) suggest an acute respiratory infection with systemic involvement. The clinical course and findings are consistent with a severe viral pneumonia, complicated by underlying comorbidities.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
1. Provide supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate saturation levels.
2. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically pending further diagnostic results.
3. Implement supportive care measures including hydration and pain management as needed.
4. Monitor vital signs and respiratory status closely in a designated isolation room.
5. Arrange for repeat imaging studies and possible bronchoscopy if indicated by clinical course or test results.
6. Consult infectious disease specialists and pulmonology for further guidance on management based on final diagnosis.
7. Educate the patient and family about the nature of his illness, expected treatment course, and importance of adherence to prescribed therapies.
8. Arrange for social work consultation to support the patient's needs given his living situation and reduced mobility.
