He describes the stools as narrow and ribbon-like, accompanied by rectal bleeding noted in two instances over the same period. The patient denies any pain during defecation or other associated symptoms such as diarrhea or constipation.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has a history of hypertension, managed with ramipril 10 mg daily since 2010, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, treated with metformin 850 mg twice daily initiated in 2015. He is also a current smoker with a pack-year history of 30.

Family History (FH):

Social History (SH):
The patient works as an accountant and lives alone. He reports occasional alcohol consumption, limited to weekends and a maximum of two drinks per session. No significant travel history recently.

Physical Examination (PE):
Abdominal examination shows no distension or tenderness; normal bowel sounds noted on auscultation. Digital rectal examination reveals firm nodularity in the posterior rectal wall, suggestive of possible mass formation. Anoscopy confirms a visible tumor lesion located at the rectosigmoid junction.

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation and physical findings, the primary concern is a lower gastrointestinal malignancy involving the rectum or anus, likely at the rectosigmoid junction given the anoscopic findings.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Arrange for urgent colonoscopy to further evaluate extent of the tumor.
- Referral to oncology for potential biopsy and staging assessment.
- Discuss smoking cessation strategies with patient to improve overall health outcomes.
- Ensure continuity of care for existing comorbidities, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.
- Educate the patient on the importance of follow-up and adherence to the proposed management plan.
