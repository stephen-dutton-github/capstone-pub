Initial Diagnosis:
The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a gastrointestinal malignancy, including dysphagia to solids, odynophagia, and unintentional weight loss.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Priya Patel, a 64-year-old female, reports experiencing progressive difficulty swallowing solid foods over the past three months. She describes this difficulty as painful and has noted an associated weight loss of approximately 8 pounds in the same timeframe. The patient denies any history of similar symptoms previously.

Past Medical History (PMH):
- Hypertension managed with lisinopril
- Hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin
- Non-smoker, no significant alcohol use
- No family or personal history of gastrointestinal malignancies

Medications:
- Lisinopril 20 mg daily
- Atorvastatin 80 mg daily

Family History (FH):
No reported family history of gastrointestinal malignancies.

Social History (SH):
The patient is married and has one child. She engages in regular physical activity but reports no significant occupational or recreational exposures that could contribute to her current symptoms.

Physical Examination (PE):
- General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
- HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic; oral mucosa normal, no lymphadenopathy
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
- Gastrointestinal: Mild epigastric tenderness, no palpable masses

Initial Diagnosis:
Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, a gastrointestinal malignancy is strongly suspected. The specific location of this potential cancer appears to be within the lower third of the esophagus based on symptomatology.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Order endoscopy with biopsy of the esophagus
- Obtain CT scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast to assess for local extension or distant metastases
- Arrange consultation with gastroenterology for further evaluation and management
- Continue current medications until further advised by the gastroenterologist
- Provide supportive care as needed, including pain control and nutritional support
