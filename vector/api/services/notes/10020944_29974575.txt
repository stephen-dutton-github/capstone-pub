Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10020944
- Admission ID: 29974575
- Patient Name: Tahmina Rahimi
- Patient Age: 72 years old

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a disseminated granulomatous disease, characterized by widespread involvement of multiple organs. The clinical picture includes systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, along with non-specific respiratory complaints.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Tahmina Rahimi, a 72-year-old female, was referred from her primary care physician due to persistent symptoms over the past three months. She reports experiencing high fevers up to 102°F, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of five pounds. Additionally, she has complained about feeling fatigued and has noticed new-onset cough with shortness of breath on exertion.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease stage III. She completed her pneumococcal vaccination series but is currently not up-to-date on influenza vaccinations.

Medications:
Tahmina Rahimi is currently taking metformin for diabetes management, lisinopril for hypertension, and losartan for kidney protection.

Family History (FH):
Her family history includes a first-degree relative with tuberculosis (TB).

Social History (SH):
The patient denies smoking or alcohol use. She lives in a close-knit community with multiple family members, some of whom have recently traveled abroad to areas with high TB prevalence.

Physical Examination (PE):
On examination, Tahmina appears pale and fatigued but is well-appeased in no acute distress. Vital signs show fever at 101.5°F, heart rate slightly elevated at 90 bpm, respiratory rate at 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure within normal limits at 120/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. Lung exam reveals scattered rales bilaterally; cardiac exam is unremarkable.

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, an infectious disease workup has been initiated. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a highly infectious granulomatous process with multi-organ involvement, possibly related to her family travel history and living situation.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
Further diagnostic tests are pending including sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli and serum interferon-gamma release assays to rule out TB. Given the high suspicion for TB, broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically while awaiting results. The patient will be admitted for close monitoring and isolation precautions until further notice. A consultation with infectious disease has been requested for expert guidance in management. Education regarding TB transmission and precautions has been provided to both Tahmina and her family members.
