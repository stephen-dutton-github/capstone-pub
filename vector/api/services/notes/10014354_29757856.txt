Patient Information:
Patient ID: 10014354
Admission ID: 29757856
Patient Name: Min-Jun Kim
Patient Age: 60 years old

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, dyspnea, and cough productive of yellowish sputum. The onset was sudden, with systemic features including fatigue and myalgia.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reports an initial feeling unwell on February 10th, which progressively worsened over the following days despite self-care at home. He started taking paracetamol for fever relief and used a humidifier to manage cough and congestion. However, his condition did not improve, prompting him to seek medical attention.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is a smoker with a 30-pack-year history but has attempted quitting multiple times without success. He completed his last pneumonia vaccination two years ago.

Medications:
Currently taking Ramipril 5 mg daily for hypertension and Atorvastatin 20 mg daily for hyperlipidemia. No antibiotics or respiratory medications prescribed recently.

Family History (FH):
No immediate family members with a history of severe pulmonary disease. His father died from complications related to diabetes mellitus, aged 75.

Social History (SH):
Works as an accountant in an office setting. Has not traveled outside the country for work or leisure in recent months. Reports social distancing and mask-wearing since learning about his initial symptoms due to concerns over community spread of a respiratory virus.

Physical Examination (PE):
Vital signs: Temperature 38.4Â°C, pulse 100 bpm, blood pressure 135/90 mmHg, oxygen saturation 88% on room air.
General appearance: Alert but appears uncomfortable and fatigued.
Respiratory: Crackles heard in bilateral lower lobes; decreased breath sounds over these areas.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops detected.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.
Neurological: Alert and oriented, no focal deficits.

Initial Diagnosis:
The clinical presentation and physical examination findings suggest a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract, likely due to a viral pathogen. Differential diagnoses include bacterial pneumonia versus viral-induced pneumonitis such as influenza or other respiratory viruses with pandemic potential.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
Immediate management will focus on supportive care including oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula to maintain saturation above 92%, hydration through IV fluids, and antipyretics for fever control. Monitoring of cardiac and respiratory status is critical given the patient's history of COPD.
Given the high index of suspicion for a viral etiology, empirical antibiotic therapy will be delayed until further testing results become available. Infection control measures will be strictly adhered to due to potential contagious nature of his illness.

Further diagnostic tests ordered include complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), chest X-ray, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses.
