Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic atrial enlargement.

Family History (FH):
The patient's family history includes a first-degree relative with atrial fibrillation.

Social History (SH):

Physical Examination (PE):
Vital signs show a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, and oxygen saturation at 93% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally.

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest a likely diagnosis of atrial flutter or fibrillation given his known history of chronic atrial enlargement and family history.

- Continue current medications until further evaluation.
- Schedule a cardiology consult for comprehensive management.
- Educate patient on recognizing symptoms of worsening heart failure, particularly shortness of breath at rest.
