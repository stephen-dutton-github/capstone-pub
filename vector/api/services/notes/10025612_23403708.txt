Initial Diagnosis:
The patient's clinical presentation suggests an acute respiratory infection, possibly complicated by her pre-existing COPD and recent history of pneumonia.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
1. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential bacterial causes.
2. Start supplemental oxygen therapy as needed based on arterial blood gas results.
3. Administer antipyretics for fever management.
4. Monitor respiratory status closely, with plans to consider non-invasive ventilation if oxygen requirements increase.
5. Ensure hydration and maintain diabetes control by monitoring glucose levels regularly.
6. Consult pulmonology for further evaluation and management.
7. Educate patient and caregiver on signs of worsening condition and when to seek immediate medical attention.

The treating physician will review these findings and determine the appropriate course of action based on the evolving clinical situation and response to treatment.
