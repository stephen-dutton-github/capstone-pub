- The patient presents with severe pain in the left hip area, difficulty ambulating without support, and a history of recent fall.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
- The patient reports experiencing significant pain localized to the left hip region following a slip on wet ground two days ago. Since then, he has been unable to bear weight or walk independently.
- The pain worsens with any attempts at ambulation and is described as a sharp, shooting sensation.

Past Medical History (PMH):
- Hypertension
- Diabetes mellitus type 2
- Previous left total knee replacement (TKR) for osteoarthritis
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intolerance due to gastrointestinal issues

Medications:
- Current: Glyburide 5 mg daily, Lisinopril 10 mg daily, Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily, Aspirin 81 mg daily (with caution due to NSAID intolerance)
- Recent prescriptions: Gabapentin 300 mg three times a day for neuropathic pain management

Family History (FH):
- Mother deceased from coronary artery disease; father deceased from stroke
- Two siblings with hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2

Social History (SH):
- Lives alone in a one-story house with modifications for mobility issues
- Denies smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use
- Engages in occasional light physical activity such as walking in the community

Physical Examination (PE):
- General: Alert and oriented, no acute distress
- Musculoskeletal: Significant tenderness to palpation over the left hip joint with limited range of motion; unable to bear weight on the affected leg
- Neurological: Normal strength and sensation in lower extremities without focal deficits

Initial Diagnosis:
- Based on clinical presentation and examination findings, a high index of suspicion is raised for an occult fracture around the hip area.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Obtain immediate radiographs of the left hip to confirm or rule out any fractures.
- If confirmed, consider surgical intervention depending on fracture type and patient's overall medical condition. Consult orthopedic surgery for evaluation.
- Continue pain management with alternative medications as needed due to NSAID intolerance.
- Ensure close monitoring of vital signs and manage any acute issues that may arise from this injury.
- Educate the patient and family about the importance of weight-bearing restrictions until further assessment by orthopedics.
- Arrange for physical therapy consultation post-surgery or confirmation of fracture to address mobility limitations.
