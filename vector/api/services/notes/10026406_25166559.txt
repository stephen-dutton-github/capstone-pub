Initial Diagnosis:
The primary concern for this patient at admission is an acute respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough, and dyspnea.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Imani Okafor presents with a one-week history of progressive cough productive of yellowish sputum, high-grade fever, and shortness of breath. The symptoms have worsened over time despite taking over-the-counter medications and rest. She denies any recent travel or known exposure to anyone with similar symptoms.

Past Medical History (PMH):
Imani has no significant past medical history except for hypertension that is well-controlled with medication. She has not had a flu shot this season.

Medications:
Current medications include losartan 50 mg daily and paracetamol as needed for fever.

Family History (FH):
There is no family history of respiratory disease or immunodeficiency disorders.

Social History (SH):
Imani works as a healthcare provider and lives with her spouse and two children. She reports smoking half a pack of cigarettes per day but denies alcohol use.

Physical Examination (PE):
Vital signs show elevated temperature (38.5Â°C), heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 88% on room air. General appearance shows signs of mild distress. Lung examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lower lobes, more prominent on the left side. There are no other abnormal findings.

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection is made, complicated by the presence of pneumonia-like symptoms. Differential diagnoses include viral pneumonia versus bacterial pneumonia.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
Initiate treatment with intravenous antibiotics pending further investigations to identify the causative organism. Administer supportive care including fluids and oxygen supplementation as needed. Chest X-ray will be performed to assess lung involvement. Educate Imani about the importance of completing her course of antibiotics and advise smoking cessation for overall health improvement. Arrange follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen.
