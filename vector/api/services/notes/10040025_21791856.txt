Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10040025
- Admission ID: 21791856
- Patient Name: Anna Müller
- Patient Age: 64

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient presents with acute onset of fever, chills, cough, and difficulty breathing. Vital signs reveal tachypnea (26 breaths per minute), elevated temperature (102°F), and oxygen saturation at 92% on room air.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Anna Müller, a 64-year-old female, reports a week-long history of worsening respiratory symptoms following a recent upper respiratory tract infection. She has experienced progressive dyspnea, night sweats, and fatigue, leading to hospital admission today due to severe respiratory distress.

Past Medical History (PMH):
- Hypertension managed with lisinopril
- Type 2 diabetes controlled with metformin
- Hyperlipidemia treated with atorvastatin
- Previous history of bronchitis, treated conservatively
- No significant allergies reported

Medications:
- Lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension
- Metformin 850 mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes
- Atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for hyperlipidemia

Family History (FH):
- Father died from lung cancer at age 70; mother deceased due to heart disease
- One sibling with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Social History (SH):
- Smoker (pack-year history: 30)
- Lives alone, retired school teacher
- No recent travel or exposure to individuals with similar symptoms

Physical Examination (PE):
- General: Alert and oriented, appears acutely ill; use of accessory respiratory muscles noted.
- Respiratory: Tachypneic, adventitious lung sounds consistent with consolidation in the right lower lobe. Crackles and rhonchi heard upon auscultation.
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs or gallops.
- Other systems: Normal

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the patient is suspected to have a severe bacterial lung infection, likely involving the right lower lobe. Differential diagnoses include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), pneumonitis, and possible exacerbation of underlying chronic pulmonary disease.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting common CAP pathogens
- Administer supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels
- Monitor vital signs closely and adjust treatment based on clinical response
- Consider chest X-ray or CT scan for further evaluation, if necessary
- Educate patient on the importance of completing antibiotic course and adhering to follow-up appointments with her primary care physician
- Arrange for social services consultation due to living alone and recent respiratory symptoms.

Further diagnostic testing and follow-up will be arranged as needed based on the patient's response to initial management.
