Initial Diagnosis:
The primary diagnosis is a complex pancreatic lesion, likely an encapsulated cystic tumor with associated pseudocyst formation. Differential diagnoses include pancreatic adenoma and pancreatic cancer.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Order imaging studies, including CT scan of the abdomen with contrast enhancement to better visualize the pancreatic mass
- Arrange for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to assess biliary tree involvement
