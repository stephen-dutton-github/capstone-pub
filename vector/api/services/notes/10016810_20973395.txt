Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10016810
- Admission ID: 20973395
- Patient Name: Chen Wei
- Patient Age: 66 years old

Initial Diagnosis:
Aged 66, presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough, and dyspnea. The clinical presentation is concerning for severe respiratory involvement.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reports a recent history of travel from Wuhan, China to the United States. He has experienced persistent fever over the past five days, accompanied by productive cough and shortness of breath that escalated quickly. He denies any recent contact with known cases or high-risk areas.

Past Medical History (PMH):
No significant medical history reported. The patient is not immunocompromised and has no chronic conditions noted in his records. Last seen for a routine check-up 3 months ago, which was unremarkable.

Medications:
No medications currently prescribed as there were no previous chronic health issues identified.

Family History (FH):
No relevant family medical history reported.

Social History (SH):
The patient is retired and lives alone with no known close contacts in the United States. He was last in Wuhan for a business trip approximately four weeks ago, returning to the U.S. on January 25th, 2020.

Physical Examination (PE):
Vital signs show elevated temperature at 38Â°C, tachypnea with an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and blood pressure slightly above normal limits. Lung examination reveals bilateral rales consistent with pulmonary infiltrates. Chest X-ray indicates extensive bilateral ground glass opacities, suggestive of severe pneumonia.

Initial Diagnosis:
The clinical presentation, travel history, radiographic findings, and laboratory results indicate a viral respiratory infection likely caused by an emerging pathogen. Differential diagnoses could include influenza or other community-acquired pneumonia. Given the patient's recent travel to Wuhan, China, and current symptomatology, this case is concerning for a severe respiratory illness.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
Admit to an isolation ward for close monitoring and supportive care, including oxygen supplementation as needed. Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy considering potential bacterial superinfection, pending further diagnostic results. Consult infectious disease team for guidance on antiviral therapy, given the suspicion of viral etiology. Educate patient about infection control measures and precautions due to suspected contagious nature of his illness. Arrange for follow-up testing including viral PCR and serology as soon as available.
