History of Present Illness (HPI):
Ms. Zara Malik presents to the emergency department with acute onset of high fever (>39°C), non-productive cough, progressive shortness of breath over 3 days, and recent contact history suggestive of COVID-19 exposure within the community. She also reports a loss of appetite, general malaise, and has been experiencing fatigue for approximately one week prior to presentation.

Past Medical History (PMH):
Ms. Malik has no significant past medical or surgical history except for mild hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor, and occasional asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids as needed.

Current medications include Ramipril 5 mg daily for hypertension and Albuterol inhaler as required for asthma symptoms.

Physical Examination (PE):
- Vital Signs: Temperature >39°C, pulse 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24/min, oxygen saturation 88% on room air.
- General: Alert and oriented but appears fatigued and dehydrated.
- Respiratory: Crackles in bilateral lower lobes, decreased breath sounds.

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation and investigations, the primary diagnosis for this patient is a severe respiratory infection characterized by high fever, cough, dyspnea, and hypoxia. The differential diagnosis includes viral pneumonias such as COVID-19 considering the exposure history and community contact.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
The patient will be admitted to an isolation ward for close monitoring given the strong likelihood of infectious etiology and the potential for COVID-19 transmission. An arterial blood gas analysis has been ordered, along with chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Empirical antibiotic therapy targeting bacterial pneumonias will be initiated pending further results from investigations. Oxygen supplementation will be administered as required to maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels (>90%). Contact tracing will also begin immediately given the patient's work setting in a healthcare facility.
