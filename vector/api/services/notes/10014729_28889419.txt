The patient will be started on supplemental oxygen therapy to correct hypoxemia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be initiated pending further testing for bacterial or atypical pathogens. Given the possibility of a viral infection, antiviral therapy will also be considered based on test results. The patient will undergo COVID-19 PCR testing and serology. She will be educated on respiratory hygiene practices and isolation precautions to prevent transmission to others. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation will be performed. Follow-up with infectious disease for evaluation and management as needed.
