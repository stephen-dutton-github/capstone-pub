Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10016150
- Admission ID: 29374560
- Patient Name: Sarah Anderson
- Patient Age: 69 years old

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of severe lower respiratory tract infection characterized by fever, persistent cough, and dyspnea.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Sarah Anderson, a 69-year-old female, was admitted to the hospital after experiencing worsening shortness of breath over the past five days. She reports a non-productive cough for one week and developed fevers peaking at 102°F two days prior to admission. She denies any history of recent travel or contact with known COVID-19 cases.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is an active smoker with a 40 pack-year history. She underwent left mastectomy for breast cancer two years ago and completed adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation.

Medications:
- Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg daily for hypertension
- Atorvastatin 20 mg daily for hyperlipidemia
- Salmeterol inhaler twice daily as needed for COPD
- Prednisone tapering dose due to previous cancer treatment

Family History (FH):
Her mother died from stroke at age 75, and her father died from lung cancer. Her younger brother has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Social History (SH):
The patient is married with two children, both living in separate households. She works as an administrative assistant in a non-healthcare setting and reports wearing masks when interacting with coworkers due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Physical Examination (PE):
Vital signs show hypoxia with oxygen saturation at 88% on room air and fever of 100°F. Respiratory examination reveals bilateral rales and rhonchi, more pronounced in the left lower lobe. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable. The remainder of the physical exam is non-specific for other underlying acute issues.

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest severe respiratory infection likely secondary to viral etiology given her age, comorbidities, and current community prevalence.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics due to clinical suspicion of bacterial superinfection.
- Provide supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min with continuous pulse oximetry monitoring.
- Administer antipyretics as needed for fever control.
- Initiate bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroid taper given her COPD history.
- Consult pulmonology for further management and consideration of antiviral therapy given her symptoms' severity and the current COVID-19 pandemic in the community.

Follow-up:
Continue monitoring vital signs and respiratory status closely. Educate patient on disease process, treatment expectations, and importance of adherence to prescribed therapies. Arrange follow-up appointment with primary care provider post-discharge for ongoing management of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD, as well as reassessment of her cancer survivorship plan.
