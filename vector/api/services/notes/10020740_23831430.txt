Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10020740
- Admission ID: 23831430
- Patient Name: Omar Farah
- Patient Age: 56

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient presents with systemic symptoms indicative of a chronic, disseminated infectious process affecting multiple organ systems.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Mr. Farah reports experiencing fatigue for the past six weeks, accompanied by night sweats and low-grade fever. He also notes weight loss over this period, approximately 5 kg. The patient denies any localizing symptoms such as cough or chest pain but admits to shortness of breath on exertion.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension for which he takes metformin and lisinopril respectively. He also reports previous treatment with isoniazid prophylaxis due to a positive tuberculin skin test, completed four years ago.

Medications:
Metformin 850 mg twice daily
Lisinopril 10 mg daily

Family History (FH):
No immediate family members are known to have tuberculosis or other infectious diseases. The patient's father died from lung cancer at age 65.

Social History (SH):
The patient is a retired teacher, married with two adult children. He denies smoking and alcohol consumption but acknowledges occasional use of marijuana in his younger years.

Physical Examination (PE):
Vital signs: Temperature 37.2Â°C, pulse 85 bpm, blood pressure 115/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
General appearance: Thin and pale with visible muscle wasting but no acute distress.
Lungs: No rales, rhonchi or wheezing noted. Chest X-ray shows diffuse bilateral infiltrates suggestive of miliary pattern.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender with normal bowel sounds; mild hepatomegaly noted.
Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy.

Initial Diagnosis:
The clinical presentation and radiographic findings suggest a chronic, disseminated infectious process affecting multiple organ systems. The differential diagnosis includes reactivation of latent tuberculosis, given the past history of prophylaxis and current systemic symptoms.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
Admit for inpatient care with isolation precautions due to potential contagiousness.
Initiate empirical antituberculous therapy, including isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Monitor liver function tests closely due to the risk of hepatotoxicity with these medications.
Consult infectious disease and pulmonology for further evaluation and management.
Consider bronchoscopy if no improvement in symptoms or radiographic findings are noted after two weeks of treatment.

Further diagnostic workup including sputum acid-fast bacilli smear, culture, and interferon-gamma release assays will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
