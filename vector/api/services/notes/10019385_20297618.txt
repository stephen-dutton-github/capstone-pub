Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation, imaging studies, and family history suggestive of a pulmonary infection, the differential diagnosis includes disseminated mycobacterial infections.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia, pending further diagnostic workup.
- Obtain sputum samples for acid-fast bacillus culture and susceptibility testing.
- Begin empirical treatment with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol to cover mycobacterial infections.
- Consider consultation with infectious disease specialist given the patient's significant family history of tuberculosis.
- Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and respiratory status closely due to the severity of presentation.
- Educate patient on the importance of treatment adherence and potential side effects of medications.

Further diagnostic studies will include chest CT scan, high-resolution CT scan of the lungs, and lymph node biopsy if indicated. The patient will be admitted under isolation precautions given the suspicion for infectious diseases that can spread through airborne transmission.
