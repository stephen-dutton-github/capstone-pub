Patient Information:
 
Patient ID: 10004457
Admission ID: 23251352
Patient Name: Olivia Smith
Patient Age: 65


Initial Diagnosis:

The primary assessment based on available data and clinical findings suggests chronic, progressive cardiac valvular disease affecting both the mitral and aortic valves.


History of Present Illness (HPI):

Olivia Smith presents with complaints of increasing shortness of breath at rest and during exertion over the past 6 months. She has noted persistent palpitations and fatigue. Her symptoms have worsened despite taking medications for her condition. Recently, she experienced an exacerbation requiring urgent medical attention.


Past Medical History (PMH):

Olivia Smith has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes mellitus. She has been under treatment with antihypertensive agents and statins, along with insulin for glycemic control. She also has a documented history of chronic atrial fibrillation, which has been managed with warfarin.


Medications:

Antihypertensives: Amlodipine 10 mg daily
Statins: Atorvastatin 80 mg daily
Insulin (as needed) for diabetes management
Warfarin for atrial fibrillation


Family History (FH):

Her mother died from congestive heart failure and her father had a myocardial infarction at age 70. Olivia has one sibling who is currently healthy.


Social History (SH):

Olivia Smith is a retired teacher living alone. She denies smoking or alcohol use but admits to consuming two cups of coffee daily. She engages in light physical activities.


Physical Examination (PE):

Vital signs: Blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 70 bpm
Cardiovascular examination:
- Heart sounds reveal loud S1 and S2 with audible holosystolic murmur at the apex and diastolic rumbling sound along the left sternal border consistent with mitral regurgitation and possible calcification. 
- Aortic component of S2 diminished, suggesting aortic valve involvement.
- The patient appeared dyspneic during examination.


Initial Diagnosis:

The clinical findings and patient's history are indicative of chronic valvular disease involving both the mitral and aortic valves, complicated by atrial fibrillation and co-existing comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus).


Plan (Treatment & Management):

1. Continue current medications for hypertension, lipid management, diabetes control, and anticoagulation therapy.
2. Arrange for echocardiography to assess the extent of valvular involvement and evaluate left ventricular function.
3. Refer to a cardiologist for further evaluation and potential intervention given her worsening symptoms despite medical management.
4. Discuss lifestyle modifications including dietary adjustments and physical activity guidance with the patient.
5. Educate Olivia Smith on signs of worsening heart failure or arrhythmias and when to seek immediate care.

This plan will be reviewed and updated based on additional diagnostic findings and consultation outcomes.
