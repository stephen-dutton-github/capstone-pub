The right lower extremity shows significant bruising and swelling around the midsection of the thigh, with obvious deformity of the femur. No neurovascular deficits are noted at this time.

Initial Diagnosis:
The primary diagnosis is a severe traumatic injury to the femur involving comminuted fractures with extensive soft tissue damage.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
The patient has been referred to orthopedic surgery for urgent evaluation and possible internal fixation or external fixation, depending on the severity of the fracture and associated soft tissue injuries. Pain management will include opioids as needed, along with regional nerve blocks for postoperative pain control. Intravenous antibiotics have been started due to open wounds and potential contamination risk. The patient's orthopedic consult is expected within 30 minutes. Regular monitoring of vital signs, including serial hemoglobin levels, will be conducted to manage her hypovolemia.
