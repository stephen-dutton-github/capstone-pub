- Admission ID: 22896692
- Patient Name: Noor El-Sayed
- Patient Age: 91 years old

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Noor El-Sayed is an elderly female who reported feeling unwell for the past four days. She initially presented with low-grade fever but has since progressed to high-grade fever accompanied by productive cough and increasing difficulty in breathing. The patient denies any recent travel history or contact with individuals exhibiting similar symptoms.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has a significant medical history including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. She is currently on ramipril, metformin, and losartan for her conditions. There is no record of any recent hospitalizations or vaccinations.

Medications:
- Ramipril
- Metformin
- Losartan

Family History (FH):
The patient's family history includes a sister who passed away from pneumonia but no other significant medical conditions noted among first-degree relatives.

Social History (SH):
The patient lives in a long-term care facility where there have been reported cases of an outbreak within the last week. She spends her days primarily indoors and receives regular assistance with activities of daily living due to her age and underlying chronic diseases.

Physical Examination (PE):
Vital signs: Temperature 102Â°F, heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 24/min, oxygen saturation at room air is 88%. Physical examination shows wheezing on auscultation, coarse crackles in bilateral lower lung fields, and decreased breath sounds. No lymphadenopathy or abdominal tenderness noted.

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient's clinical presentation suggests a severe respiratory infection complicated by her underlying comorbidities. Given the reported outbreak at her long-term care facility, there is a high suspicion for an infectious etiology.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
The patient will be started on empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy considering the high-risk nature of her conditions and the suspected infectious agent. Continuous oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula will be provided to maintain adequate oxygen saturation. She will also receive intravenous hydration and pain management as needed. Close monitoring of vital signs, renal function, and blood glucose levels will be implemented due to her comorbidities. Further diagnostic tests such as chest X-ray, complete blood count, and C-reactive protein are planned for today to confirm the diagnosis.
