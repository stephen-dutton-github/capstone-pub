Initiate aspirin 325 mg chewable tablet, clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose, IV heparin, and sublingual nitroglycerine for chest pain relief. Arrange for cardiac biomarker panel (troponin) and serial ECGs as per hospital protocol. Consult cardiology team for potential angiography and possible revascularization strategy.

Monitor vital signs closely and manage any complications related to ACS. Educate patient on the importance of adhering to prescribed therapies and lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risk factors, including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation if applicable.
