Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10020187
- Admission ID: 26842957
- Patient Name: Abigail Thompson
- Patient Age: 63 years old

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient presents with systemic symptoms suggestive of a disseminated infection, characterized by low-grade fever, fatigue, and weight loss over the past two months. The presence of bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates noted on chest radiograph further supports this diagnosis.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Abigail Thompson, a 63-year-old female, reports experiencing persistent symptoms for approximately eight weeks. She describes feeling fatigued most days, intermittent low-grade fever, and unexplained weight loss. Additionally, she has noticed increasing shortness of breath during routine activities.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient's past medical history is notable for hypertension, treated with amlodipine 10 mg daily, and mild asthma managed with an albuterol inhaler as needed. She completed treatment for community-acquired pneumonia approximately one year ago.

Medications:
- Amlodipine 10 mg daily
- Albuterol inhaler as needed

Family History (FH):
The patient's family history includes a first-degree relative with tuberculosis, which was successfully treated several years prior.

Social History (SH):
Abigail Thompson is a retired teacher. She lives alone and reports no significant travel or recent exposure to individuals with infectious diseases in the past year.

Physical Examination (PE):
- Vital signs: Temperature 38Â°C, pulse 90 bpm, BP 120/80 mmHg, SpO2 92% on room air
- General appearance: Thin, appears fatigued but alert and oriented
- Respiratory: Bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates noted on chest radiograph; no crackles or wheezing heard on auscultation.
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate, normal heart sounds
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender
- Extremities: No edema

Initial Diagnosis:
The clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest a highly infectious process with systemic involvement. Given the patient's age and risk factors, including a positive family history, miliary disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Initiate empiric antimicrobial therapy covering tuberculosis until further diagnostic confirmation.
- Obtain sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli staining and culture.
- Order a chest CT scan to assess the extent of pulmonary involvement and rule out other causes of miliary appearance.
- Consult pulmonology for further evaluation and management.
- Monitor vital signs closely and provide supportive care as needed.
- Educate patient on the importance of adherence to treatment protocol once diagnosis is confirmed.

This admission note does not directly state "miliary tuberculosis" but presents clinical indicators and a differential diagnosis that would lead to this consideration, while maintaining a focus on the patient's systemic symptoms and pulmonary findings.
