- Neurological: Gait unsteady, slow speech with long latency between responses to questions. No focal deficits noted on motor or sensory examination.

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's age, medical history, and clinical presentation, a primary consideration is dementia as evidenced by cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances. Delirium has been ruled out due to lack of acute features such as sleep disturbance, inattention, and fluctuating levels of consciousness. Other encephalopathy remains a possibility given his comorbidities.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Comprehensive neurological evaluation including MRI brain imaging and lumbar puncture to rule out infectious etiologies.
- Cognitive assessment using standardized tools like MMSE and clock drawing test.
- Initiate cholinesterase inhibitor therapy pending confirmation of dementia diagnosis.
- Manage behavioral disturbances with risperidone 0.5mg twice daily, titrating as needed based on response and side effects.
- Encourage family education about the patient's condition to improve support at home.
- Arrange for a social worker consultation to address social isolation and potential benefits from adult day care programs.
- Continue current medications for chronic conditions and monitor for medication-related side effects in relation to cognitive decline.
