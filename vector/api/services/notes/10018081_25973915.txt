Initial Diagnosis:
The clinical presentation is consistent with an acute respiratory infection secondary to a viral pathogen. The imaging findings support this assessment. Differential diagnoses include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or influenza.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Initiate broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy targeting common pathogens associated with severe infections in the elderly, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.
- Administer supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 above 90% via nasal cannula.
- Place on contact precautions given the viral nature of her infection.
- Monitor vital signs closely, particularly respiratory status.
- Consult infectious disease for further evaluation and management.
- Arrange for daily nursing assessments due to dementia.
- Educate patient and family on infection control measures and signs to watch for that would necessitate immediate medical attention.
