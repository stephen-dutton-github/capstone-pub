Physical Examination (PE):
On examination, Imani appears dehydrated but is alert and oriented. Vital signs show an elevated temperature of 38.2Â°C, blood oxygen saturation at 92% on room air, and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral crackles consistent with interstitial lung disease; there are no clear wheezes or rhonchi indicative of asthma. The remainder of her examination is unremarkable.

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic workup, this patient has a severe respiratory infection likely due to an atypical pathogen, complicated by underlying COPD and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation including COVID-19 testing. Treatment will include supportive care with hydration and supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain adequate oxygen saturation. Antibiotics will be initiated pending culture results, and antiviral medications may be considered if COVID-19 is confirmed. The treatment plan also includes close monitoring of her respiratory status due to the presence of bilateral crackles suggesting possible pneumonia. Regular updates on her clinical condition will be provided to her primary care physician for continued management.
