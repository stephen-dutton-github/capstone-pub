Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10015860
- Admission ID: 28196804
- Patient Name: Zara Malik
- Patient Age: 53

Initial Diagnosis:
Evaluating for a respiratory infection secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome with suspected viral etiology.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Zara Malik, a 53-year-old female, presented to the emergency department complaining of fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath that began three days ago. She denies any recent travel or contact with known COVID-19 cases but reports significant exposure during public gatherings in the community.

Past Medical History (PMH):
Patient has a history of asthma treated with an inhaler as needed and hypertension managed with lisinopril 10 mg daily. No other comorbidities reported.

Medications:
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

Family History (FH):
No significant family medical history provided.

Social History (SH):
Patient reports living alone, working as a healthcare provider at an assisted living facility, and participating in regular community events.

Physical Examination (PE):
Vital signs include fever of 102.5Â°F, tachypnea with respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 88% on room air. Physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing bilaterally on lung auscultation. No other notable findings reported.

Initial Diagnosis:
The patient's clinical presentation and history suggest a severe respiratory infection likely due to a viral pathogen. Differential diagnoses include influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or COVID-19. Given the recent community exposure, COVID-19 cannot be excluded as a potential etiology.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
Initiate empiric treatment with antibiotics and antivirals pending further diagnostic results to cover potential bacterial superinfection and address viral pathogen. Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, monitor vital signs closely, and consider intubation if respiratory status deteriorates. Educate patient on the importance of hand hygiene and social distancing while in the hospital.

Further workup includes complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), chest X-ray, and COVID-19 testing. Follow up with infectious disease consultation for ongoing management.
