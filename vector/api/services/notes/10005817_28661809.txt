Past Medical History (PMH):
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for 10 years
- Hypertension managed with medication
- History of smoking (40 pack-years)

Medications:
- Albuterol inhaler as needed
- Ipratropium bromide inhaler twice daily

Social History (SH):

Physical Examination (PE):
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute, increased effort noted
- Oxygen saturation: 88% on room air, improving with supplemental oxygen
- Use of accessory muscles for breathing observed
- Lungs: Bilateral coarse crackles and wheezing heard, more pronounced on the left side
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardia present (104 bpm)
- No other abnormalities noted during the exam

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation and history, the primary diagnosis is likely severe exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pneumonia superimposed.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Continue supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation above 90%
- Initiate intravenous antibiotics covering for typical respiratory pathogens
- Administer bronchodilators and corticosteroids as per protocol for COPD exacerbation
- Monitor vital signs closely, including oxygen saturation and heart rate
- Arrange for chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis to confirm diagnosis and assess severity
- Educate the patient on proper inhaler use and importance of smoking cessation
- Consider pulmonary rehabilitation consultation for long-term management
- Social work involvement for support system assessment and possible home safety evaluation due to lack of caregiver
