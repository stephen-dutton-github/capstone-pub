Yuki Kato, a 66-year-old female, was admitted to the hospital due to complaints of high-grade fever, chills, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath for five days. The onset of these symptoms was abrupt, with rapid progression despite initial treatment at home.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has no significant past medical history except for mild asthma treated with an inhaler as needed. She is a nonsmoker, does not drink alcohol, and maintains regular physical activity.

Medications:
At the time of admission, she was taking her usual medications for asthma (fluticasone inhaler) and also received antibiotics (cefuroxime 500 mg every 8 hours) prescribed by her primary care physician before hospital admission due to a perceived upper respiratory infection.

Family History (FH):

- General appearance: Coughing, appears fatigued but oriented.
- Respiratory: Bilateral crackles audible on auscultation of the lungs. Decreased breath sounds noted in the right lower lobe (RLL). No wheezes or rales.

Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation and radiological findings, the patient likely suffers from a severe bacterial pneumonia, complicated by atelectasis in the RLL.

- Provide supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation.
- Administer analgesics for chest pain relief.
- Initiate respiratory therapy including incentive spirometry to aid lung expansion.
- Arrange for a follow-up consultation with pulmonology within one week or sooner if symptoms worsen.
- Educate the patient and family about the importance of completing antibiotic therapy, monitoring for potential side effects, and adherence to follow-up appointments.
