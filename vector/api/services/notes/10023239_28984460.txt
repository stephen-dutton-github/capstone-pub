Initial Diagnosis:
Pulmonary infiltrates with diffuse micronodules and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Nora Johansen, a 29-year-old female, presented with a chief complaint of progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past three months. She also reports a recent history of intermittent low-grade fever and night sweats. The patient denies any cough or hemoptysis.

Past Medical History (PMH):
The patient has no significant past medical history apart from mild asthma, well-controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators.

Medications:
- Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhaler 250/50 mcg twice daily
- Montelukast 10 mg once daily

Family History (FH):
No known significant family history of tuberculosis or any other respiratory conditions.

Social History (SH):
Nora Johansen is a non-smoker, does not consume alcohol regularly. She lives with her partner and works as an accountant in a multinational firm. No recent travel outside the country was reported.

Physical Examination (PE):

- Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally; no wheezes or crackles noted.
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
- Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Initial Diagnosis:
The primary impression based on radiographic findings and clinical presentation is a granulomatous lung disease. Differential diagnoses include sarcoidosis, lymphoma, or an infectious etiology given the systemic symptoms of fever and night sweats.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Order high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of chest to better delineate pulmonary infiltrates.
- Initiate empirical anti-tuberculosis therapy pending further diagnostic workup.
- Schedule a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage for cytology and culture.
- Monitor vital signs closely, particularly temperature, given the systemic symptoms.
- Provide supportive care including oxygen supplementation as needed.
- Educate the patient on the importance of medication adherence and potential side effects of anti-tuberculosis therapy.
