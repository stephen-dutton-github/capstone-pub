Plan (Treatment & Management):
Initiate isolation precautions until further notice based on potential infectious agent. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals as per protocol once infection is identified.

Educate the patient about the importance of isolation and adherence to prescribed therapies. Arrange for follow-up appointments post-discharge.
