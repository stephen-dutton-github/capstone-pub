Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation and history, an infectious etiology is suspected with differential diagnoses including severe pneumonia or atypical pulmonary infection, possibly complicated by a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

Plan (Treatment & Management):
The patient will undergo further diagnostic evaluation including chest X-ray, complete blood count (CBC), procalcitonin levels, sputum and blood cultures. He will be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics pending culture results and provided supportive care with fluids, antipyretics, and supplemental oxygen as needed based on continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status. Further consultations with a pulmonologist and infectious disease specialist are planned to manage his condition appropriately.

The patient has been counseled about the importance of completing diagnostic tests and adhering to prescribed treatments when indicated. He has been advised on signs of worsening symptoms that should prompt immediate medical attention, such as increased difficulty breathing or severe chest pain.
