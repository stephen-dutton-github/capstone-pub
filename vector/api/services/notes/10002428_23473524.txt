Patient Information:
- Patient ID: 10002428
- Admission ID: 23473524
- Patient Name: Jiahao Chen
- Patient Age: 80 years old

Initial Diagnosis:
The primary concern for Mr. Chen's admission is a severe infection characterized by fever, chills, and hypotension. The patient presents with a respiratory tract infection that has progressed to bacteremia.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Mr. Chen, an 80-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital after experiencing increasing shortness of breath, productive cough, and high-grade fever for five days. He reports a recent episode of pneumonia treated three weeks ago with antibiotics, which resolved. Currently, he is unable to sit upright without assistance due to extreme weakness.

Past Medical History (PMH):
- Hypertension
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Previous hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia treated with azithromycin

Medications:
- Current medications include metformin and lisinopril for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, respectively. He also takes a combination inhaler containing salmeterol/fluticasone for COPD management.

Family History (FH):
No significant family medical history reported by the patient or available in his medical records.

Social History (SH):
Mr. Chen is widowed, lives alone, and has limited mobility due to arthritis. His social support includes a home health aide who assists him with daily living activities.

Physical Examination (PE):
- Vital signs: Temperature 38Â°C, blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm
- Respiratory: Dyspneic at rest, audible wheezing and crackles in the bilateral lower lobes. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air.
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops heard.
- General: Appears lethargic, weak.

Initial Diagnosis:
The primary diagnosis considered for Mr. Chen's current condition includes a severe infection due to Gram-negative bacteria, likely Pseudomonas aeruginosa, complicated by his immunocompromised state from COPD and diabetes. The patient's recent history of pneumonia and ongoing respiratory symptoms raise concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia or hospital-acquired infection.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Administer broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics including a carbapenem such as meropenem, given the risk of multidrug-resistant organisms.
- Provide supportive care with oxygen supplementation to maintain adequate saturation levels and fluid management to correct hypotension.
- Monitor vital signs closely and reassess frequently for signs of deterioration or improvement.
- Consult infectious disease for guidance on antibiotic stewardship due to his high-risk profile.
- Involve the respiratory therapy team for possible intubation if respiratory status worsens.
