Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation and history, a severe lower respiratory tract infection complicated by significant hypoxia and multi-system involvement is suspected. Differential diagnoses include viral pneumonia and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
- Initiate empiric treatment for presumed viral pneumonia due to COVID-19 with oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily and dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for seven days.
- Provide supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute.
- Arrange for rapid antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2.
- Monitor vital signs closely, particularly respiratory status and oxygen saturation. 
- Encourage hydration and monitor renal function due to potential medication effects.
- Educate patient on the importance of isolation precautions within the facility and maintain contact precautions for healthcare workers.
- Arrange for follow-up care with infectious disease consultation and pulmonology as needed based on test results and clinical evolution.
