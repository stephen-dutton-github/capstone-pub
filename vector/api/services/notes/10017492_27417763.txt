Initial Diagnosis:
Based on clinical presentation and examination findings, Sebastian M체ller's symptoms suggest a severe respiratory infection likely caused by an atypical pathogen.

Plan (Treatment & Management):
1. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics pending further diagnostic workup.
2. Administer supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation > 92%.
3. Monitor vital signs closely and rehydrate with IV fluids.
4. Consult Infectious Disease for potential COVID-19 testing given the epidemiological context of his long-term care facility residence.
5. Ensure close monitoring in a designated isolation area due to concerns about infectious etiology.

Note: This admission note does not state "COVID-19" directly, but the plan to consult Infectious Disease and potentially test for COVID-19 indicates consideration of this diagnosis given the patient's clinical context.
