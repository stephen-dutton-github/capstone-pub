Miliary tuberculosis is a form of tuberculosis where the infection spreads through the bloodstream, causing small white spots (like millet seeds) on various organs such as the lungs, liver, and spleen. Therefore, it is essentially a disseminated or advanced stage of tuberculosis, hence the two diagnoses can be considered adequately similar to define the same condition."
